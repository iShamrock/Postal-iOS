>On March 10, 2015, which is today, Apple officially released their new product – Apple Watch. Together came with a new Xcode with WatchKit. With this tool, we built Postal Wear for Apple Watch. On the watch, logics are simplified. Just press the screen, you can record your reading, sleeping, running that easy. The activities recorded on your phone will be transferred to your phone and then be uploaded into the server.
